# New Exchange
An exchange marketplace written in Go.

### What is an exchange?
A marketplace where buyers and sellers interact to trade listed products at an agreeable price.

### What is the goal of the project?
- Learning about exchanges.
- Learning go language in the process
- Building something interesting.
- Possibly providing an alternative implementation for proprietary software.

### Milestones.
Software is never finished, but I only have limitted time, so I need to break this project up into milestones. See the list below with links:

1 - All in one file. No outside access. [V1 Working File](docs/milestone_1.md).

2 - Adding authentication for traders and a basic trading API.

3 - The exchange in two pieces, separating order matching from order placing.

4 - The API as it's own piece separate from the order placing.

5 - System verification. A way for us to verify that the system works correctly.
